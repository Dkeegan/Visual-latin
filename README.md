# Visualize-Latin
A website that shows images of a representation of a Latin word.

The goal is to help facilitate the natural language model to learn Latin. The word is supposed to be associated with the pictures that are shown. However, the fatal flaw is abstract ideas that are hard to represent - it works best with nouns. 

# TODO:

- <strike>Add word in ***lingua latina per se illustrata*** as that is the main book to learn Latin</strike>
- <strike>Clean up the front end to make it look usable</strike>
-  Add multiple sources of pictures (Unsplash) 
- Add the ability to upload pictures to demonstrate words vs relying on third part api's 
- Auto check correctness if translated
- Clean the data - it would be helpful to learn Latin to know what things actually say
- Deploy it
- Add an option to see alternative translations
- Add the ability to have user sourced words
- Add the wikidictionary information 
- Use Sentences and words from primary sources
- Gameify it (remove the Latin word from the page and have it check  to see if that is the word. This would require an extremely curated list of pictures)
- Throw in conjugations instead of the base word ( This is probably in the api or I would have to build my own. It also might not be helpful in the learning process)
- Meme mode. Only pictures based on memes.
